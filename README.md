# Global Trivia 🗺️

## Description
In this game, you are to guess the country by the flag shown. Pretty simple, right? Well, soon it won't be as features are rolled out here and there 😈  
That's all there is for now, so keep reading for installation instructions and anything else important!

## Installation
To run the application:
1. You have to clone this repo down **from this branch** with HTTPS or SSH using either your favorite IDE or the following bash command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mifi2945/Personal_Projects.git
```
2. The Maven build tool is already packaged into this project, so getting the `.jar` is farely simple! Run the following in a terminal once you're in the project folder:
```bash
./mvnw package
```
3. Finally, a target folder should appear; run the following, and your application should now be running as a `.jar`:
```bash
java -jar .\target\GitHub_Repo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
It's that simple 😊 It should be noted that you can also just run the project straight from the IDE without using Maven to *build* the project, but you still need the ```pom.xml``` file for dependencies. Make sure to run ```Launcher.java``` if using the IDE route, such as IntelliJ.
